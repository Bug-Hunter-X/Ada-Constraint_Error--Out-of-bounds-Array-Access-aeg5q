This example demonstrates a common error in Ada: accessing an array element with an index that is outside the array's bounds.  The Ada compiler doesn't catch this error during compilation; instead, it results in a runtime `Constraint_Error`. The solution shows how to avoid this error by performing appropriate range checks.
